Kriyas are a set of cleansing practices in yoga used to purify the mind and physical body.
These kriyas help cleanse the body's metabolic wastes, which, at times, the body fails to eliminate naturally. According to Hatha Yoga, this cleansing can bring harmony in the energy flow and balance three doshas – Vata, Pitta and Kapha. According to Naturopathy, an imbalance in three doshas and an accumulation of toxins can cause ailments. The practice of Kriyas before pranayama thereby helps to prevent and cure diseases.
Eye, Nose and Throat wash practices are taught and done under the supervision of qualified yoga experts daily at our hospital. Nasal wash, also called Jala Neti, is a type of kriya done to cleanse the nasal tract with saline water. Eyewash cleanses the impurities in the external eye, promotes circulation to the eye muscles and helps to cool down the system. Jala Neti or nasal irrigation/ wash is done to prevent nasal
congestion, bring out excess accumulated mucus from the sinus cavities, help improve immunity and prevent dust allergy, breathing disorders, sinusitis, respiratory illness, and headache due to congestion.
( Lagu – less, Shanka – conch, Prakshalana – Cleansing)
The body is compared to a conch and is cleansed from mouth to anus with the help of saline water. Here the water used is lesser than the actual Shanka Prakshalana procedure; hence it’s called Lagu (lesser water). As this practice cleans the entire digestive tract, it helps to improve digestion, absorption and overall metabolism.

This medical practice works based on the flow of “Chi”, which means energy which is otherwise in Indian philosophy correlated to ‘prana’ or vital energy.

The World Health Organization has recognized this medical practice system as effective for a
